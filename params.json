Copy the files and add your pages. Misto\r\nhas its own router class to parse url and show the related page files.\r\n\r\nYou can manage displays according to different user types for demo pages with the \r\nhelp of the authentication class. Misto lacks database :) There is no database \r\nconnection and database related functions. Because of this, it uses a primitive \r\nsession management to differantiate the user type.\r\n\r\nNavigation and Url classes are used for creating site navigations, setting selected \r\nmenus and building urls on the fly.\r\n\r\nOverall, it has all your needs to build scalable website or large documentation\r\nfiles, or html demos for your clients.\r\n","google":"UA-52570271-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
