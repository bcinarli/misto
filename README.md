About Misto
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misto is a PHP based micro framework for rapid prototyping HTML template demos,
static webpages or single page apps.

Why Misto is Different?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It ready to use, no installation needed. Copy the files and add your pages. Misto
has its own router class to parse url and show the related page files.

You can manage displays according to different user types for demo pages with the 
help of the authentication class. Misto lacks database :) There is no database 
connection and database related functions. Because of this, it uses a primitive 
session management to differantiate the user type.

Navigation and Url classes are used for creating site navigations, setting selected 
menus and building urls on the fly.

Overall, it has all your needs to build scalable website or large documentation
files, or html demos for your clients.
